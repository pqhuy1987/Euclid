### About the game

Euclid: The Game gamifies the 2300 years old book "The Elements" written by the ancient Greek mathematician Euclid in Alexandria.

Euclid's Elements has been referred to as the most successful and influential textbook ever written. The first level of the game is exactly the first theorem of this ancient book. Throughout the levels you unlock constructions, once you prove you are able to make them.

The web game (euclidthegame.com) is played by 500.000 users in in 213 different countries, we hope that as much people will enjoy the much improved iOS game (to be released september 2015). The game teaches highschool geometry. But anyone from any age with enough patience and determination should be able to solve the puzzles.

This iOS game also includes lots of hints that explains in an interactive way many geometric concepts.
